Category tree is similar to filesystem folder 
structure, with no specific limits on nesting
or content. A category tree can be used to
provide "single-tag" classification to organize
and search content more effectively than 
a tag cloud: e.g. tag "cat" is replaced by 
category 'Animals > Pets > Cats' or user-provided
 trees(instead of tags).
