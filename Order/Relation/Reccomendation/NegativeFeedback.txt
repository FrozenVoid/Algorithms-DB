most reccomendation algorithms lack
an option to tune the source weights:
all related content is treated the same.
A negative feedback option would 
expose the "source error":
e.g. You were reccomended X because of Y(specific
 content piece/tag/category interest),
would you like to:
1.Exclude Y from reccomendations
2.Downrank Y weight in reccomendations
3.Increase Y weight in reccomendations
Most websites think the algorithm would
eventually deduce user preferences after
a thousand "dislike" interactions but these
interactions will generate another chain
of disliked content.
