A place rank system uses two algorithms:
1.Upvote/downvote move the place-of-content +1/-1 in rank respectively.
e.g. forum thread with 1 upvote, placed 3rd in rank/list, given one upvote
will be place at 2nd place in list/rank.

2.Initial placement;the place-of-content is placed in front of "new queue" list 
and inserted in the specific place in "main queue" where 0 vote rank threads are placed.
The thread list queue "recently popular" may reduce rank by N per hour to
bias toward newer content.
