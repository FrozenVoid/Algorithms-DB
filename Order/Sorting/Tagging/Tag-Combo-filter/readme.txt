A tag-combo filter filters tags which reach specified
minimal values e.g.
tag-combo filter for #cat >3 #petloss >1
will filter posts with #cat tagscore more than 3
and tag #petloss with tagscore more than 1,
but posts without tag #cat will show up normally
(as e.g. user doesn't want to see this specific type of posts
due some reason).
