Anti-tag system allows users to place 'Anti-tags'/negative rank tags. e.g.
10 users add tag 'funny' displayed as +funny(10) to a post
people who subscribed to 'funny' tag will see the post, with its rank(10 users tagged)
15 users add anti-tag '-funny' which reduce +funny to (+funny(-5)) to -funny(5) anti-tag:
people who subscribed to 'funny' tag will no longer see the post.
but after a hour 40 people add 'funny' tag to the post;
the score is -5+40 is +funny(35) and the post is shown in 'funny' taglist for posts.
anti-tags are not displayed on thread/post score normally,
but will be shown if users wants to see them.
anti-tags can exist without positive tags(normal tags)
e.g. a post can have -funny(1) anti-tag score which would not show it in 'funny' taglist, until people add +2 normal tags setting tagscore to +funny(1).
