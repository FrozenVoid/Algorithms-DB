Tag-category hybrid system:
Users may posts threads if they have
positive karma score(increased by 1 per day),
and can spend N karma points for thread initial tagscore(default 1).
Categories:
Each thread is assigned by poster to a category(one category, many tags):
Shows most recent categories used by user and sitewide. 
Categories can be 
subscribed to and created, but not moderated
(scores of threads determine position,with user-specified low score filter).

tags:
users add tags to posts(posts inside thread),
threads(threads in category) and categories(category tags).
Tags can be subscribed to, and filtered/blocked.
Each comment,threads and category has a tag score:tag cloud with numbers:
score is amount of users with positive karma(you can add tags while
on negative karma, but it will not add +x to the tagscore number,
only a spot in userlist which is sorted by karma scores of users)
and reduce your own karma further into negative territory)
who added this tag.e.g. cats(42) cute(89) funny(7)
(shown only about 10-20 best scoring tags per tagged content)
Tags can be private or public:private tags
are not influencing tagscore and serve as local
tagging utility(specific to user).
Public tags lead to user profile.
e.g. clicking on cats(42) send you to userlist 
of those who tagged the content as cats(),
clicking on user transfers to that user public tag "cats" 
where all content that he tagged as "cats" 
exists sorted by recency or popularity*(total tagscores/daily tagscore).
Tags can be blocked and filtered by
1.minimum/maximum tagscore
2.text match, regex that defines a userfilter.
3.Tag Placement:up to Nth tag(1-10 first tags, by score)
e.g. filter posts with tagx appearing fifth or later,(preventing
rogue group from voting on malicious tag influencing the taglist,
but not blocking the tag itself)

karma:Users start with 0 karma and earn it
by posting comments and
A.activity: +1 day 
B.getting upvoted.
karma transfers to user(sum of all comment scores)


Karma is spent to upvote/downvote tagscores and can be
used multiple times(e.g. upvote 29 times to spend 29 karma on post).
Karma points are essentially a virtual currency for voting,
with some scarcity;

tl;dr its a much better version of reddit/digg system.
