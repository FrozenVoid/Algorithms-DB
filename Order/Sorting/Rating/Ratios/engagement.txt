Engagement ratio is calculated
as numbers of users who
viewed vs who also interacted with content.

Engegement is shaped by
visibility: low-visibility content
with high-engagement is often 
neglected(e.g. deeply nested
comments).

Example:
Post A has 3 replies and 30 views.
Post B has 6 replies and 16 views.
Post A has engagement ratio of 3/40=0.1(10%)
Post B has engagement ratio of 6/16=0.375(37.5%)
(only views of users able to reply
count here).
Despite being nearly twice less 
popular, B has three times the engagement,
thus making it a significant content
piece.
