A rate betting system consists of:
1.users placing rating points into a rateable content-piece.
e.g. UserA places 25 points to downvote ArticleX
and UserB places 50 points to upvote ArticleX.
2.After the bet is placed, its non-returnable;
other users changing the rating will influence the outcome of the bet;
3.the Article rating at each day is scored and
if its more than the time at which the bet was placed,
it gives dividends to those placing upvotes and if
its more negative than the time at which downvote bet
was placed it will provide dividends for downvotes.

4.Calculations example:
UserA places 25 points to downvote ArticleX
after a day the articles is down 1000 points;
UserA who correctly predicted the new rating
gains 25*(1000/number_of_downvoters(10))=25*100=2500 points
and the new base rating is the next day point zero;
at which point the article gains +100 points,
which loses UserA 25*(100/number_of_downvoters(10))=250 points.
with each next day adjusting points gained or lost.
