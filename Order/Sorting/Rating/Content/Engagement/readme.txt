Engagement percents measure level
of interest in a topic/post.

Formula:Ep=(Unique_Replies)/(1+Unique_Users_Engaged)
Unique_Users_Engaged = Number
of unique users who viewed and were
able to reply to original

Unique_Replies = Number of subsequent 
content posts which
is directly linked to original from unique 
users.(e.g. only first reply
from user A)

Example:
1000 unique users viewed
Post A, but only 3 replied:
thus 3/1001=0.003 or 0.3% engagement.

Advantages:
1.Reduces rank of popular but
low-engagement content pieces.
i.e. views without replies=low-rank.
2.Scales adapt to any amount
of users as its a simple ratio.
3.100% engagement cannot be easily reached
due formula for unpopular high-engagement
content, examples:
1 reply, 1 users=>1/2=50%
2 replies, 2 users->2/3=66%
5 replies, 5 users=>5/6=83%
10 replies,10 users=>10/11=0.9->90%
20 replies, 20 users=>20/21=95%
50 replies, 50 users=>50/51 98%
100 replies,100 users=>100/101=0.99->99%

vs N replies/N users formula,
which results in 100% engagement
in all above cases.
