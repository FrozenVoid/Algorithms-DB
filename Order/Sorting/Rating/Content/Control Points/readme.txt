Control Points system:
overview;
This system allows to assign/revoke pseudo-currency points(Control Points)
to alter content rating as self-correcting system:
A.that moves points from stale content to new content
B.reallocates voting power to best users at the current moment
C.Allows to assign variable amount of votes(control points)
and alter amount of support for specific piece of content.

Algorithm:
A user is awarded 1 control point at sign up
(gaining 1 points per week of active site use
condition1;
is that user must posts at least one unit 
of content per week which is awarded at 
least 1 point from other users,
if the condition is met an extra +1 control point is awarded)),

A user can vote on content posts by spending
any amount of control_points at will, and 
revoke them later, altering the content poster score(
which is used to assign new control points with some delay:
(e.g. a 24h delay))

Note:spending all points, without getting any from
other users will make the account voting power null,
until the user revokes the control points he awarded
to other users(thereby decreasing their scores);
the control points can be assigned to other 
users(even possible to assign all points to one user),
increasing their control score,
but can be removed back at any time:
if score is negative the user has to gain more 
points to restore to zero.
Advantages:
normally, karma systems lead to point inflation 
where each vote/point is meaningless and can be
awarded to all posts without losing anything.
A bot can vote up a million posts
(if the site allows this)+1 karma. 
a thousand bots can award +1000 to a million posts, 
that means an influence factor that can break/manipulate a site.
Control points on the other hand are a scarce 
resource and cannot be awarded ad infinitum 
or at will, they must come from new accounts or time.
Any content post point allocation can traced back to
its supporting graph(who assigned points to whom)
allowing to speedily resolve any spam/abuse of the system.
