When most people are presented wuth a rating
they tend to vote extreme: highest or lowest 
rating. Why this occurs:

1.Extreme votes amplify voting power
in "naive average" system, which calculate
average "score": voting 5 vs 10 dilutes the
"upvoter power".

2.They perceive the ranking will transfer
to their reccomended content better if
the algorithm is strongly encouraged/discouraged
with the rating:i.e. lowest score means=exclude 
this content,highest score=i want to see similar content.

3.Rating is often emotional reaction from
first view of content: often the viewer
 would adopt a more moderate rating after
 viewing similar content.
 
4.Extreme ratings can be viewed as applied to
content uploader: instead of rating the content,
the viewer extreme rating is expression of 
"want/don't want" this content type from uploader.

5.In some cases extreme ratings stem from
limited selection of range(e.g. 5 out of 5)
where 5 signifies some minimal standard which
would be "above 4/5" and not "best",likewise
1/5 would signify something below "2/5" and
not "worst", though best/worst will also
be lumped with 4+/5 and 2-/5 type content.
