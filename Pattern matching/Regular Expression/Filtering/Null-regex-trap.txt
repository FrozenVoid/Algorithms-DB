null regex trap;
Naive filtering with one-pass filters that don't consider their output as potential threat and remove any content that fits the regex/word being filtered - by removing the string from the content(null string).


Example:
regex filter to remove javascript tag  /<script>/ to ""(empty string)
<scr<script>ipt>  becomes <script>
  Proper way: replace <script> with arbitrary non-executable string
<scr<script>ipt> becomes <scr filt3red ipt>
