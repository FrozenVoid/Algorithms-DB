Beauty is a set of geometric constraints that can be used 
in a set of metric(symmetry, proportionality, surface curvature)
for estimation of beauty.

1.Symmetry: Symmetry is core metric of Beauty,
symmetric things signify robust and proportional design.

2.Proportionality: e.g. golden ratio proportions . 
Feature of object that are proportionate can be deduced
from measuring all parts and their space.

3.Curvature: beauty correlates 
with symmetric surface curvature that can be modeled as
a smooth curve: e.g. a sine function.

4.Complexity: complexity of structure, elaborate shapes
if symmetric, curved and proportional increase the overall beauty
of object. This is what makes objects more beautiful than 
a perfect sphere(that satisfies all above criteria):
e.g. a transparent marble with inner structure vs
 a monochrome marble.


5.Color transition smoothness:
surfaces with smooth color transitions(blended colors) are more beautiful,
as sharp transitions signify a structural change(different material).
