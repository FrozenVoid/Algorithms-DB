binary split(binary search) is a basic algorithm to determine
value in range that is closest to criteria(fitness function) if the range is ordered. If the range produces non-ordered values for criteria comparison,
the search will fail.
Steps.
1.Pick value A and B in ordered range.
2.If both A and B result below criteria, double the largest value
until its above criteria.If both are above criteria, half the smallest value
until its below criteria.
3.When you have A below criteria and B above criteria:
3a.Test value (B-((B-A)/2)) which is in between A and B(average of a <> b).
If the new(average) value is equal to criteria, A or B, the search is done.
4.If the new value is below criteria it replaces A and step 3 is repeated
If the new value is above criteria it replaces B and step 3 is repeated.
