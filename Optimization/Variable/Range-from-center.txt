Range from center algorithm is a technique to
generate trial variables for testing function optimization.
A variable X is being optimized:
1.Right array is generated with values X+(epsilon_typeof(X)*(4^array_place))
2.Left array is generated with values X-(epsilon_typeof(X)*(4^array_place))
both arrays are run through function() and best value in the array,
as determined by fitness to criteria is set as new X,
which can be later used again to generate another set arrays,
until the center value is determined to be the best by criteria.
