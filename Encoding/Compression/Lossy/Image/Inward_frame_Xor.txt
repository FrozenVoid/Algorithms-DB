A 1-pixel wide outer frame
of an image(all edge lines as square) is stored,
as NxM template.
Each iteration is xoring
the inner frame(1-pixel to center)
and storing this difference,
until the center frame is reach.
Deconding: the initial frame
square is xored with inner frame
XOR values to reconstruct it,
then another inner frame.
