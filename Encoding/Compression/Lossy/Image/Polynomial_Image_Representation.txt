General idea:
Image components are 
split(chroma,luma,alpha) 
and converted to large integers,
 a polynomial of form
 base^a-base^b+base^c-base^d...
 is optimized using iterative
repair to approach the 
integer value of image component.
base and array of powers are
saved instead of component.
Decoder just evaluates the 
polynomial, discarding the fractional part.
