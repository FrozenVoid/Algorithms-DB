1.file is converted to a bitset array.
2.bitset array is converted to
gray code(x^(x>>1))
3.the amount of resulting bit
transitions is recorded as entropy
 number (see https://github.com/FrozenVoid/Infodump-DB/blob/main/Information/Entropy/bit-transitions.txt )
4.If the number of bit transitions
is lower than record,save
the bitset+number as 'best candidate'
5.Repeat 2-4 until the bitset
is equal to initial file bitset:
i.e. recurisive grey code loop end.
6.record 'best candidate' + number
of bit transitions as 'least entropy form'.
