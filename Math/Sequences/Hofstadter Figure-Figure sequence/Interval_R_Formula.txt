Hofstadter Figure-Figure sequence Nth
 R number can be approximated by interval bounded
 from ((N*N)/2)+e^(1.5*(log(N/2)) )
 to  ((N*N)/2)+e^(1.5*(log(N)) )

with upper limit being most accurate approximation
as N grows
more precise lower limit is
 from ((N*N)/2)+e^(1.5*(log((N*(0.5^(2/log(N)))))) ) for large N


log(x)  natural log
